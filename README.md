In this model, we will use the famous traffic sign dataset, German Traffic Sign. This is the traffic sign system used in the Federal Republic of Germany. This system is designed to help drivers and vehicle operators on the road understand the rules and restrictions of the road. The German traffic sign system includes many different types of signs, including prohibition signs, danger signs, directional signs, instruction signs, information signs and street signs. Each type of sign has a unique color and shape to increase effectiveness in conveying information.
German traffic signs often have a simple, easily recognizable design and are placed in locations that can be clearly seen from afar. The system also includes safety measures such as traffic lights, road markings and roundabouts to help increase the safety of drivers and vehicle operators on the road. In addition, German Traffic Sign is also used as a dataset in the field of artificial intelligence to train and evaluate traffic sign recognition algorithms.
This data set includes nearly 50 thousand images divided into 43 folders of 43 different types of signs. Each folder will have a CSV file containing information about the images in the folder. We pay attention to the following information:
- ROI: is the image area containing the license plate with information X1, Y1, X2, Y2
- ClassID: is the label of the license plate (from 0 to 42)
